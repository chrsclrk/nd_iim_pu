This project provides a Red Hat Ansible Engine working prototype to install IBM products; WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, Installation Manager and Packaging Utility.  Ansible playbooks and roles are provided to accomplish the task.  The human-friendly nature of Ansibleâ€™s domain-specific language makes these playbooks a useful complement when reading the IBM Knowledge Center.
